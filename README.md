### Tahir Malik (Data Engineer)

Greetings, <br/> 
Data is the new gold, but raw data alone isnâ€™t enough. <br>
It needs the right infrastructure to unlock its value. <br> 
Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m passionate about data engineering. <br>
Building the pipelines and systems that turn messy data into actionable insights. <br>
I enjoy solving complex problems and creating scalable solutions that make data truly useful. <br />
